# Scala version

This repository contains my solutions using Scala to Project Euler challenges.

## Rules
I'm doing these challenges in Scala to learn the language and the functional paradigm. <br> 
Therefore I want to follow a certain number of rules: 
1. No side effects.
2. Data must be immutable.
3. Solution must be produced in a reasonable amount of time.
